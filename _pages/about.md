### I am
A backend developer from Seoul.
I graduated from Sejong University with degrees in electrical and computer engineering and English language and literature.
I'm also a DevOps engineer, cloud system administrator, self-directed learner, pragmatist, and empiricist.

### This blog is
A place to share my study, experience, review, and any thoughts I want to post (maybe).

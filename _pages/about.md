I am a software engineer from Seoul.
I graduated from Sejong University with degrees in electrical and computer engineering and English language and literature.
I'm also a DevOps engineer, cloud system administrator, self-directed learner, pragmatist, and empiricist.

This blog is a place to share my studies, experiences, reviews, and any thoughts I want to post.

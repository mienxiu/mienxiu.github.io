I am a software engineer from Seoul.
I graduated from Sejong University with degrees in ECE(electrical and computer engineering) and ELL(English language and literature).
I'm also a technical writer, self-directed learner, pragmatist, and empiricist.

This blog is a place to share my studies, experiences, reviews, and any thoughts I want to post.

Took an OS class some years ago, forgot most of the content I learned, decided to summarize the essential concepts for application developers like me.

The posts are written based primarily on [CS 6200: Introduction to Operating Systems by Georgia Tech OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems).

I also used a textbook, [Operating System Concepts by Avi Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Operating+System+Concepts%2C+10th+Edition-p-9781119320913), as an additional reference.
